# Pathfinder-with-PANGU-removed
My Applied Computing Honours Degree Project


Allows a User to plot points on a map and let the program find 
 how to get to each point. At each stage new data will be found
 and used to navigate through any hazards.

History:
 Forked from the real HONOURS Project to remove its associations 
 with PANGU(Planet and Asteroid Natural Scene Generation Utility)
 created by the University of Dundee.
